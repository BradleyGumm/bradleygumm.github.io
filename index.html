          <h4>Programming</h4>
          <h5>Networking Software</h5>
          <p>I enjoy programming applications involving networks. For example, I have made chat programs, remote control of computer functions (Remote command execution, Remote restart/shutdown, ect).</p>
          <h5>Mathematics</h5>
          <p>I love creating fun programs to calculate constants such as using 4,000,000 random numbers to estimate PI.</p>
          <h5>Cryptography</h5>
          <p>One of my absolute favorite topics to program around is cryptography. I made a chat program and implemented the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and AES 256, and another version that implements RSA. Also, I've experimented with using the voltage spikes of an Arduino's digital pin to try generating random numbers. Then I analyzed the numbers and realized it just output a wave.</p>

        	<h4>Activities</h4>
        	<h5>I thoroughly enjoy going to the gym.</h5>
        	<p>I can accidentally spend hours at the gym and yet I dislike running.</p>
        	<h5>Skating</h5>
        	<p>I love skating, I still have issues with the mental barries of trying to grind a ledge but I still find ways to have fun.</p>
